Using bamboo charcoal to remove bad odors from your refrigerator is an easy and natural solution. Here's a step-by-step guide:

Materials Needed:
Bamboo charcoal: You can purchase bamboo charcoal in loose form or in pre-made sachets designed for odor absorption.
A breathable pouch (optional): If you have loose bamboo charcoal, you can put it in a small cloth pouch, mesh bag, or sock to contain it.
Steps:
Prepare the Bamboo Charcoal:

If you’re using loose bamboo charcoal, place it into a breathable pouch or container with small holes (e.g., a plastic container with tiny perforations).
Clean the Refrigerator:

Before placing the bamboo charcoal, ensure your fridge is clean. Remove any spoiled food and wipe down surfaces with a mild soap solution or a mixture of vinegar and water.
Place the Bamboo Charcoal:

Put the bamboo charcoal sachet or container on a shelf inside your refrigerator.
For larger refrigerators, you might need multiple sachets or containers to cover all areas.
Leave It in Place:

Bamboo charcoal works best when left undisturbed for several days. It will absorb odors naturally over time.
Refresh the Charcoal (Optional):

Every month or so, recharge the bamboo charcoal by placing it in direct sunlight for 2–4 hours. The sunlight helps release the absorbed odors, allowing the charcoal to continue working effectively.
Replace the Charcoal:

Bamboo charcoal can be used for up to a year if regularly recharged. After that, you can replace it with new charcoal.
Additional Tips:
Bamboo charcoal is safe to use and doesn’t emit any chemicals, making it a good choice for areas with food.
After its life as an odor absorber, used bamboo charcoal can be added to your garden soil as a fertilizer.
This method is effective, eco-friendly, and inexpensive!
